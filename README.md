## About The App
Wordium docs is a word processor application that provides for input, editing, formatting, and output of text, with some additional features....

## Screenshots

![Writing](https://res.cloudinary.com/evergreenx/image/upload/v1644680734/project_1_dgnqd3.png)

## Technologies
I used `react`, `nextjs`, `firebase firestore` for database , `draft js` for text editor , `next-auth` for user authentication and `tailwindcss` for styling.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- get your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID  and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET variables  from [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis)

## Approach
I adopted the `reuseable` based style for my react components to build encapsulated components that manage their own state then compose them to make complex UIs. 

## Status
wordium docs is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out soon.
